# z-index-optimizer

## A CLI to help you take control of the z-indexes in your codebase.

z-indexes can be a pain to manage. Often, they are scattered throughout your codebase, it can be hard to know which ones are in use, and which ones are not. In hindsight, it's easy to wish that they had been organized in a more logical way.

`z-index-optimizer` aims to provide a solution to this problem, it can:

- [x] Scan your codebase for z-indexes
- [x] List them out sorted by their frequency of use
- [ ] Assign them to a logical grouping
- [ ] Automatically update your codebase to use the new grouping
